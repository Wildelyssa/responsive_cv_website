				<h2 class="title">Junior Web Developer</h2>
				<h3 class="name">Hello world!</h3>
				<p class="cover-text">I am a Junior Web Developer with strong skills in Html and CSS, and a good foundational knowledge of JavaScript. I love to build and create Websites and Emails which are functional as well as creative, with a view to responsive design. I am currenlty looking for freelance projects to be a part of, as well as my first position with a company.</p> 
				<p class="cover-text">From running my own business as a Holitic Therapist, I gained experience of designing and developing Html and CSS Emails, as well as managing and running a mailing list and email marketting campaigns. If you think your business could benefit from this serveice, please don't hesitate to contact me for a consultation.</p>
				<p class="cover-text">Working in creative roles has given me a good eye for design. My creativity helps me find innovative solutions to issues, and to clearly visualise the end result. Analytical work is equally enjoyable to me. I love problem solving, and have excellent attention to detail.</p>
				<p class="cover-text">I am an upbeat person, who is well-organised and reliable. I've been forunate enough to work in some diverse working environments, with some great teams of people. This has taught me the value of communication and maintaining great working relationships.</p>
				<p class="cover-text">I am driven and have a huge passion for learning. Over the past 6 months, I have been undertaking an online course with Zero To Mastery Academy entitled The Complete Web Developer. This course covers all of the foundations of coding as a coding bootcamp, and is a registered Academy. Throughout the course, and in my own extra time, I have completed several small projects to showcase and practise my skills in Html, CSS, and JavaScript.</p> 
				<p class="cover-text">Please check out my <a class="text-link" href="https://github.com/Wildelyssa" target="blank">GitHub</a> for examples of my latest work.</p>
